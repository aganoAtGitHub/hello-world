# hello-world

GitHub seems fun. I worked with many variations of RCS/VCS, such as, ClearCase, VisualSourceSafe, SVN, CVS, so on and so forth.
Branching with those tools does not happen with a couple of clicks like it does with GitHub. Merging can be pain in the neck depending on how many people have touched the same lines in the same source file while it was checked-out.
I am impressed so far with how easy it is to create a branch, make changes to a file, commit those changes and merge the branch into Main.

1. To create a branch you basically click on your repository's master/branch dropdown, cleack on the branch tab and type-in your branch name, for example: for my master named hello-world, i created a hello-world-branch.

2. Make your changes to a source file(s) and then commit your changes directly to the branch.

3. Merge the branch to Main: 
3a. Create a Pull Request from the changes you made to a source file in your Branch.
Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.

As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.
By using GitHub’s @mention system in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they’re down the hall or 10 time zones away.

You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It’s a great way to learn the GitHub Flow before working on larger projects.
3b. To create a pull request:
-  Click the  Pull Request tab, then from the Pull Request page, click the green New pull request button.
-  Select the branch you made, hello-world-branch, to compare with master (the original).
-  Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they’re what you want to submit.
-  When you’re satisfied that these are the changes you want to submit, click the big green Create Pull Request button.
-  Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes.
-  When you’re done with your message, click Create pull request!
-  Tip: You can use emoji and drag and drop images and gifs onto comments and Pull Requests.

3c. The actual MERGE Step: Merge the branch into Main:
- In this final step, it’s time to bring your changes together – merging your readme-edits branch into the master branch.
- Click the green Merge pull request button to merge the changes into master.
- Click Confirm merge.
- Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated, with the Delete branch button in the purple box.
