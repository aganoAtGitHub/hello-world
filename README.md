# hello-world

GitHub seems fun. I worked with many variations of RCS/VCS, such as, ClearCase, VisualSourceSafe, SVN, CVS, so on and so forth.
Branching with those tools does not happen with a couple of clicks like it does with GitHub. Merging can be pain in the neck depending on how many people have touched the same lines in the same source file while it was checked-out.
I am impressed so far with how easy it is to create a branch, make changes to a file, commit those changes and merge the branch into Main.
