# hello-world

GitHub seems fun. I worked with many variations of RCS/VCS: ClearCase, VisualSourceSafe, SVN, CVS and so on so forth.
Branching with those tools does not happen with a couple of clicks like it did with GitHub. Merging is the different story as well.
Impressed so far with how easy it was to create a branch. I will be more impressed once i see how merging goes.
